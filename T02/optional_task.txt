# Optional Task 
- Write pseudocode for an algorithm that asks the user for a number and stores that number in a variable called n.
  Then the algorithm calculates and prints out the first n numbers in the fibonacci sequence

## Pseolution

//function

Function fibonacci
	
	Pass in: n, first, second

	// variable declaration
	create variable count
	create variable third assigned to first + second

	// Processing
	
	while count is less than n:
		print first
		print second
		print third
		
		first = second 
		second = third
		third = first + second
		count increases by one 
		


Endfunction


// variable declaration

create variable n assign it to user input requesting for a number

create variable first and assign it 0

create variable second and assing it 1

// Processing

type cast n into an int

pass n first and second into fibonacci function
