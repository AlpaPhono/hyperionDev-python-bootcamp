# Problem 1
- An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly unti the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input

## Pseolution
make empty list called numbers 

make variable called number equal to none

while number is not 0:
	get number
	append number to list called numbers.

When loop ends print largest number in the list 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 2
- An algorthim that reads an arbitary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average

## Pseolution
put arbitary number of integers in a list

calculate the sum of the integers in the list

divde the sum of the list by the length of the list

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 3
- An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products inn alphabetical order that are still left to buy

##Pseolution
put "grocery list" in a list

check if item in list is bought
	if bought pop from list 

sort remaining items in list by alphabetical order

print out list 

# Probem 4
- An algorithm of the flowchart

##Pseolution

populate variables for x and y

variable s = x + y
variable A = s / 2
variable P = x * y

print the values of s, a and p
